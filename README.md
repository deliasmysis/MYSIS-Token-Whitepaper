# 🦐 MYSIS Token - Decentralized by Design, Driven by Culture

**MYSIS** is a meme-powered BEP-20 token launched on the BNB Smart Chain, inspired by the mysid shrimp — a small but resilient sea creature.

This project is a fusion of meme culture and serious decentralization. No pre-mines. No venture capital. No tax. Just pure, transparent community-driven liquidity.
